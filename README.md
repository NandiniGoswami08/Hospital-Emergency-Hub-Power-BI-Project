# Hospital-Emergency-Hub-Power-BI-Project (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using POWER BI DESKTOP)
## Project Descriptive
The Hospital Emergency Hub Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze emergency department data, focusing on patient admissions, wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals. The dashboard provides insights for hospital management to improve operational efficiency and patient care.

## Requirement gathering 
### KPI Requirements 
â€¢ Number of Patients:

1 Major the total number of patients visiting the Emergency hub daily.

2 Display a daily trend using and areas sparkline to understand pattern overtime, such a peak days or seasonal trends.

â€¢Average Wait Time:

1 Calculate the average time patients wait before attended to buy a medical professional.

2 Use and areas sparkline to show day fluctuations and identify days with higher wait time that may require operational adjustment.

â€¢Patient Satisfaction Score:

1 Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evaluate the quality of a service provided

2 Present a daily trend using an areas sparkline to identify dips in a satisfaction and correlate them with operational challenges or a peak time.

â€¢Number of Patient Referred:

1 Count the number of patients referred to specific department from the Emergency hub each day.

2 Use and area sparkline to track daily trends and identify department with highest referral rates, which may require additional resources.
